## About Us
This yearâ€™s members for 5327X are all from different backgrounds and have different experiences. Some on the team have participated in previous events and taken part in competitions. Some know about robotics and engineering, while others are just beginning. Nonetheless, our team will embark on a path for our robotics competition this year. We will all work together to make new things possible, while working as a close connected team. In general, we have all given ourselves roles and jobs such that we can understand the different aspects of engineering while working together as a team. Going into this season, we shall all play our part responsibly to strive for the excellence we seek in competitions. As of now, we are all as part of a team and we will do what we can to make it to the highest spots possible and strive to achieve more and more at the VEX 2022-2023 tournaments!
